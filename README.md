Unveiling C-C Couplings via Secondary Alcohols and Boronic Acids: Machine Learning-based New Reactions Discovery
Direct carbon-carbon bond (C-C) couplings between unactivated secondary alcohols and boronic acids without transition-metal catalysis represent an atom-economical and environmentally friendly approach. However, this method presents notable challenges. This work aims to accelerate the exploration of emerging areas in organic chemistry by developing a machine learning (ML) guided workflow for reaction discovery. By harnessing the statistics of 762 related transformations involving boronic acids and activated moieties as the knowledge source, the optimized ML model enables accurate (correlation coefficient R2 = 0.92) and extrapolative reaction predictions. This model is utilized for in silico screening of 100 potential reactions, leading to the identification of several reactions of synthetic interest. The top four high-scoring new reactions are experimentally verified, demonstrating broad substrate scope and moderate to good yields. Mechanistic investigations, employing density functional theory (DFT) and experimental research, provide evidence for the formation of a crucial ortho quinone methide (o-QM) intermediate, elucidating the mechanistic basis for these reactions. We envision that adopting a machine learning approach like this enables the rapid development of various reaction fields beyond C-C couplings.
