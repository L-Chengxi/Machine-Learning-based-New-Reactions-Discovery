# Machine-Learning-based-New-Reactions-Discovery
Our GitHub repository hosts the code for a machine learning (ML)-guided workflow designed to expedite the discovery of direct carbon-carbon (C-C) couplings between secondary alcohols and boronic acids. This approach addresses the challenge of efficiently identifying viable reactions while promoting atom economy and environmental sustainability. The significance of this software lies in its ability to revolutionize reaction discovery by leveraging ML algorithms. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset comprising 761 transformations involving boronic acids and activated moieties, our optimized ML model enables precise predictions and extrapolations. This accelerates the screening process, allowing researchers to experimentally validate promising reactions more efficiently. Ultimately, this approach facilitates the exploration of alternative methods for target reactions, broadening the scope of reaction design possibilities.
Key Features:
- Utilizes machine learning algorithms to guide reaction discovery.
- Facilitates precise predictions and extrapolations with a correlation coefficient (R²) of 0.92.
- Enables screening of potential reactions, leading to experimental validation of the most promising ones.
- Demonstrates efficacy across diverse alkenyl boronic acids and secondary alcohols with varying substituents (R² ranging from 0.89 to 0.98).
- Provides a rapid methodology for effectively screening viable secondary alcohols for C-C couplings with boronic acids, supported by ML predictions.
