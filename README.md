# Machine-Learning-based-New-Reactions-Discovery
Direct transition-metal-free carbon-carbon (C-C) couplings between secondary alcohols and boronic acids present an atom-economical and environmentally friendly approach but remain challenging. This study endeavors to accelerate reaction discovery through the development of a machine learning (ML)-guided workflow. Leveraging data from 761 pertinent transformations involving boronic acids and activated moieties as the knowledge source, the optimized ML model facilitates precise predictions (correlation coefficient R² = 0.92) and extrapolations. Screening 100 potential reactions resulted in the experimental validation of the four most promising reactions across diverse alkenyl boronic acids and secondary alcohols with varying substituents (R² ranging from 0.89 to 0.98). This yielded a series of 2-(4-phenylbut-3-en-2-yl)phenols, which could be further transformed into valuable scaffolds. This study provides a rapid methodology for effectively screening viable secondary alcohols for C-C couplings with boronic acids, supported by ML predictions. Such an approach facilitates the exploration of alternative methods for target reactions and expands the horizons of reaction design possibilities.
