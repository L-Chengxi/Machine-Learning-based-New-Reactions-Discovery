# Machine-Learning-based-New-Reactions-Discovery
Welcome to the Machine-Learning-based-New-Reactions-Discovery GitHub repository. Our project utilizes advanced machine learning (ML) techniques to streamline the discovery of novel carbon-carbon (C-C) coupling reactions. This repository contains the code for our ML-guided workflow, designed to facilitate the direct C-C couplings between secondary alcohols and boronic acids, thereby promoting atom economy and environmental sustainability.
Our ML algorithms are trained on a dataset of 761 transformations involving boronic acids and activated moieties. The model demonstrates high predictive accuracy with a correlation coefficient (R²) of 0.92, enabling researchers to prioritize and experimentally validate promising reactions with greater efficiency.
 **Key Features:**
- Employs machine learning to guide the discovery of chemical reactions.
- Achieves precise predictions and extrapolations with high correlation coefficients (R² up to 0.98).
- Efficiently screens potential C-C couplings, accelerating the path to experimental validation.
- Applicable across a diverse range of alkenyl boronic acids and secondary alcohols.
- Offers a rapid screening methodology underpinned by robust ML predictions.
